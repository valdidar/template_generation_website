It published only short stories and was known for originality and for promoting new writers. It was quickly successful, aided by the popularity of \"The Mysterious Card\", by Cleveland Moffett, which appeared in an early issue, selling out two print runs. Two of its best-known contributors were Jack London, whose 1899 story \"A Thousand Deaths\" sold just as he was about to give up attempting to become a writer, and Henry Miller, whose first published works were several short fiction critiques published in 1919. The magazine's ownership changed in 1912 and 1919 as its circulation declined, and it initially ceased publication in 1920. It was revived in 1922 by William Kane, but in early 1923, with estimated circulation down to only 15,000, it ceased publication for good.</p><p contenteditable=\"true\">The Black Cat was an American fiction magazine launched in 1895 by Herman.
